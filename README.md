# PSYCHEDELIC PULSATING FACE FILTER 

With this project, I wanted to create something super trippy, as if you were in a psychedelic haze. I did this by adding circles that would pulsate and fade in and out with very vibrant colours all over top a trippy gif. Furthermore, I tried to figure out a way to add a moving/transitioning graident bakcground, alas, I was unssuccessful. Lastly, I tried to find a way to speed up the pulsating circles as the faster the the speed the crazier it got, however, I was unable to find a way to make it speed either with a button or through movement on the screen.
